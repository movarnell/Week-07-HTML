   <!-- This was just added so that I could refer back to it and remember why I made this site. I want to save it so that years from now I can look back with some nostalga. Not sure if this is an OK place to ask you questions, but is it ok to write the code using word wrap in VS code like I did here or is it better for me to manually break the lines for others to review in case they aren't using VScode?-->

The project was inspired by a request from my son for a site about fingerboarding, and was created with the goal of showcasing my skills and knowledge in HTML.

    My name is Michael Varnell and I am excited to present this project, which showcases my ability to create websites and web pages using HTML only. This project is a testament to my dedication and hard work as a student in the Bootcamp, and I am proud to share it with you.</p>
